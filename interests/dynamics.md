Recent research indicates that shifts in host-associated microbiota align with niche changes during complex life cycles. However, the factors influencing these shifts and host mechanisms for maintaining key microbiota remain poorly understood beyond a few model systems. In a project to describe the microbiota across the developmental cycle of Onthophagus taurua, I discovered that the microbiota of O. taurus varies in composition and abundance based on host life stage, with some influence from sex. Notably, transitionary life stages (e.g., eggs and pupae) don't restrict microbiota maintenance; they can contain microbiota with richness and abundances equaling or exceeding other stages.
