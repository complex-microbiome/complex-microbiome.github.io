<p><span class="image left"><img src="{% link assets/images/o_tau_BC.jpg %}" alt="" /></span>Recent research indicates that shifts in host-associated microbiota align with niche changes during complex life cycles. However, the factors influencing these shifts and host mechanisms for maintaining key microbiota remain poorly understood beyond a few model systems. In a project to describe the microbiota across the developmental cycle of <i>Onthophagus taurus</i>, I discovered that the microbiota of <i>O. taurus</i> varies in composition and abundance based on host life stage, with some influence from sex. Notably, transitionary life stages (e.g., eggs and pupae) don't restrict microbiota maintenance; they can contain microbiota with richness and abundances equaling or exceeding other stages.</p>
