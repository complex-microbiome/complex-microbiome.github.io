<p><span class="image left"><img src="{% link assets/images/j-jones.jpg %}" alt="" /></span>I'm a 5th year Ph. D. candidate researching in the <a href="https://ecoevodevo.com" target="_blank">Moczek Lab</a> at Indiana University. I am broadly intersted in the ways organisms interact with the complex microbial communities inhabiting them and, more specifically, what traits may have been evolved by those host organisms to maintain and control those communities across generations and life stages.</p>
